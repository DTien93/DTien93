- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tiáº¿n
- I aspire to be a Front-end developer. Never stop learning and trying to be a good person.
- Learning new languages and technologies is what I am passionate about. I am considered a
team-player because I like to help other and tend to work well within the group. I can also do some
mentoring tasks and do code reviews for other team members.
